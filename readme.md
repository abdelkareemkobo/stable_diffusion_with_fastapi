# FastAPI Stable Diffusion Image Generator

## Introduction

This project leverages FastAPI and the Stable Diffusion model with Dramatiq to create images from text prompts and store them in cloud storage. It provides an easy-to-use API for generating images from text inputs.

## Technologies Used

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/VITA-Group/Stable-Diffusion): A generative model for creating images from text prompts.
- [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/): A distributed task processing library.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): A deep learning framework used for running the Stable Diffusion model.
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A Python Imaging Library used for image processing.

## Features

This project offers the following features:

- **Generate Images**: Create images from text prompts.
- **Guidance Scale**: Option to provide a negative prompt for guidance during image generation.
- **Customizable Inference Steps**: Specify the number of inference steps for image generation.
- **Callback Function**: Support for progress tracking using callback functions.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server.

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. The FastAPI server should now be running locally. You can access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Usage

### Generate Image

To generate an image from a text prompt, make a POST request to the `/generate-image/` endpoint with the following JSON data:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Your text prompt here",
  "negative_prompt": "Optional negative prompt for guidance",
  "num_steps": 50
}
```

- `prompt` (string, required): The text prompt for image generation.
- `negative_prompt` (string, optional): A negative prompt for guidance during generation.
- `num_steps` (integer, optional): The number of inference steps (default: 50).

The API will respond with a Base64-encoded image.

This project is currently in development and may receive updates and improvements in the future.
